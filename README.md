# Mixtaper
A web app which allows you to input songs in the form of youtube links and will make you a mixtape of those songs in mp3 format.


Made using FastAPI and Python as the back-end and ReactJS as the front-end.

The API uses the yt-dlp package to download songs and the pydub package to manage the song files. 

The API has been hosted on Heroku - https://mixtaperr.herokuapp.com/docs#/

The front-end is currently being built.
